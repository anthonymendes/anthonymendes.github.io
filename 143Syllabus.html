<p>Workshop is a Credit/No Credit course that coincides with your Calculus 3
lecture. It is an opportunity for students to gain additional guided
practice and work in teams to tackle challenging concepts. The facilitator
attends every lecture and has access to all of the course material so this
workshop is specifically tailored to Dr. Mendes' Calculus 3 class! If you
would like to enroll or have any questions please contact Alex at
aschwa29@calpoly.edu, or attend the first workshop on Tuesday, 3/29 from
6:10-7:30 PM (Location 24-108).
</p>

<h2>Tutoring</h2><p>Free tutoring is available from the <a href="https://calpoly.mywconline.com/">Writing and Learning Center</a>.  Graduate
and undergraduate math tutors are available for both one-to-one and
small-group sessions.
</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2><p>The Cal Poly Calculus text is <em>Calculus, 8th ed</em> by James Stewart.
</p>

<p>The text will be used as a reference to augment the lectures and exercises.
At times we may not be following the text exactly.  This text will also be
used in Math 241 (Calculus IV).
</p>

<h2>Course content</h2><p>I have been greatly looking forward to sharing the ideas in this course with
you!
</p>

<p>The topics are found in chapters 10--13 of our textbook.  These are
extremely useful topics which find numerous applications in a wide variety
of subjects.  The <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-outlines">official department course outline</a> contains more details.
</p>

<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to
</p>

<ol><li>Classify infinite series as convergent or divergent using standard tests
such as the comparison tests, the ratio test, and the root test.</li>
<li>Calculate power series and Taylor series and find their radius of
convergence.</li>
<li>Apply the concepts of parametric equations and polar coordinates to
problems in Calculus.</li>
<li>Understand vector algebra and elementary differential vector calculus.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grading</h2><p>Letter grades are based on in class blue book exercises, group quizzes,
homework exercises, two midterms, and a final exam.  The proportions of the
total grade given to each activity are:

<h2>Exercise Sets</h2><p>The exercise sets are important and high quality work is expected.  You will
not receive credit for an exercise unless work is included.  Please turn in
assignments of a quality appropriate for a professional workplace.
</p>

<p>Please get started on the exercises early!  To keep everyone on track, late
assignments will be penalized 20% per day late.  If life issues get in the
way, please let me know before the assignment is due so that we can make
special arrangements.
</p>

<p>Follow these steps when turning in the assignments and exams:
</p>
<ol><li>Neatly and clearly write out the solutions by hand.  This may require
writing rough drafts; please do not submit messy scratch work.</li>
<li>It is difficult to read and grade <kbd>.jpg</kbd> image files, so please create a
single <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file from your exercise sets using a document scanner phone
application.</li>
<li>Upload the file to in our Canvas site before the due date.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using a tablet to write out solutions or know mathematical
typesetting (LaTeX) or have any other method of creating legible solutions
in a <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file, then of course this can be used instead of handwritten
solutions.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2><p>There are two midterm exams and one final exam.  Midterm topics will be
announced in class.  The final exam is cumulative.
</p>

<p>The midterm exams are on April 22  and May 20
  during class time.
</p>

<p>The final exam for the 9am section is on June 10  at
7:10am in our classroom.
</p>

<p>The final exam for the 10am section is on June  6  at
10:10am in our classroom.
</p>

<h2>Quizzes</h2><p>Group quizzes are given in class on April  8, April 15,
  May  3, May 10, May 31.
</p>

<h2>Academic honesty</h2><p>The table below clarifies which resources are available for use on exercise
sets and exams.  A "No" means the resource is not permitted and a "Yes"
means that it is permitted.

<h2>Diversity</h2><p>I am committed to providing an atmosphere that is welcoming to everyone.  It
is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be
well served by this course.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2><p>Students registered with the Disability Resource Center should contact me
early in the course with their approved accommodations so that we can make
the necessary arrangements.
