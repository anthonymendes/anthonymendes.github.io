<h2>Web site</h2><p>The course web site is <a href="https://anthonymendes.github.io/344.html">https://anthonymendes.github.io/344.html</a>. Assignments
will be turned in on <a href="https://canvas.calpoly.edu">Canvas</a>.
</p>

<h2>Class meetings</h2><p>There are two sections of this course, both which meet on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Fridays.  The 9:10am and 10:10am sections both meet in
Building 38 Room 226.
</p>

<h2>Office hours</h2><p>Office hours are held in Building 25 Room 202.

<h2>Tutoring</h2><p>Free tutoring is available from the <a href="https://calpoly.mywconline.com/">Writing and Learning Center</a>.  Graduate
and undergraduate math tutors are available for both one-to-one and
small-group sessions.
</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2><p>Our textbook is <em>Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, 4th edition</em> by
Goode and Annin.  This is the same text as the prerequisite course (Cal Poly
Math 244).  We will not be following the text at all times as no single text
contains all of the content in our course.
</p>

<p>The text will be used as a secondary reference only.  It will be
cross-referenced with the lessons on our web page.  Exercise sets will not
come from the text.  Therefore, if textbook cost is an issue, it may be
possible to squeak by without a copy.  However, if you struggle in
mathematics classes, be sure to read the text!
</p>

<h2>Course content</h2><p>This course introduces linear methods with applications to the solution of
differential equations and partial differential equations.  Topics include
Laplace transforms, Series solutions to ordinary differential equations,
Orthogonality, the Gram-Schmidt procedure, least squares, orthogonal bases in
function spaces, Sturm-Liouville theory, and Fourier series.  The <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-outlines">official
department course outline</a> contains details on the course content.
</p>

<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to
</p>

<ol><li>Apply the technique of Laplace transforms to applications in ordinary
differential equations and linear systems,</li>
<li>Construct series solutions to linear differential equations,</li>
<li>Apply the concept of orthogonality in a variety of applications, including
regression and classification, and</li>
<li>Construct solutions to boundary value problems using Fourier Series and
Fourier transforms.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grading</h2><p>Letter grades are based on in class blue book exercises, group quizzes,
homework exercises, two midterms, and a final exam.  The proportions of the
total grade given to each activity are:

<h2>Exercise Sets</h2><p>The exercise sets are important and high quality work is expected.  You will
not receive credit for an exercise unless work is included.  Please turn in
assignments of a quality appropriate for a professional workplace.
</p>

<p>Please get started on the exercises early!  To keep everyone on track, late
assignments will be penalized 20% per day late.  If life issues get in the
way, please let me know before the assignment is due so that we can make
special arrangements.
</p>

<p>Follow these steps when turning in the assignments and exams:
</p>
<ol><li>Neatly and clearly write out the solutions by hand.  This may require
writing rough drafts; please do not submit messy scratch work.</li>
<li>It is difficult to read and grade <kbd>.jpg</kbd> image files, so please create a
single <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file from your exercise sets using a document scanner phone
application.</li>
<li>Upload the file to in our Canvas site before the due date.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using a tablet to write out solutions or know mathematical
typesetting (LaTeX) or have any other method of creating legible solutions
in a <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file, then of course this can be used instead of handwritten
solutions.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2><p>There are two midterm exams and one final exam.  Midterm topics will be
announced in class.  The final exam is cumulative.
</p>

<p>The midterm exams for both sections are on January 28  and
February 25  during class time.
</p>

<p>The final exam for the 9am section is on March 16  at
7:10am in our classroom.
</p>

<p>The final exam for the 10am section is on March 14  at
10:10am in our classroom.
</p>

<h2>Quizzes</h2><p>Group quizzes are give in class on January 14, January 21,
February 11, February 18, and March  8.
</p>

<h2>Academic honesty</h2><p>The table below clarifies which resources are available for use on exercise
sets and exams.  A "No" means the resource is not permitted and a "Yes"
means that it is permitted.

<h2>Diversity</h2><p>I am committed to providing an atmosphere that is welcoming to everyone.  It
is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be
well served by this course.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2><p>Students registered with the Disability Resource Center should contact me
early in the course with their approved accommodations so that we can make
the necessary arrangements.
