<title>Career Fair Visit</title>

<h1>Career Fair Visit</h1><p>Career fairs are great places to learn about available careers and to look for
summer internships.  Even if you plan on teaching or going to graduate school,
it is important to be aware of all of your options!
</p>

<h2>Upcoming Career Fairs</h2><p>Cal Poly has an upcoming <a href="https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/21-22-career-fairs">Career Fairs</a> on April 13  and
April 14.  You must attend the Career Fair and speak with at least
one employer (hopefully more!).  Visit the <a href="https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/">Career Services Web site</a> early and
register so that you don't miss the fair!
</p>

<p>Even though some employers may not specifically state they are looking for
mathematics majors, <strong>do not let that deter you</strong> from going after interesting
jobs!  What employer wouldn't want an intelligent, hard-working mathematics
major who has the ability to quickly learn and clearly communicate technical
ideas?
</p>

<h2>After the Fair</h2><p>Please upload your answers the following questions on Canvas by the due date
listed on the main web page.
</p>

<ol><li>Which employers did you talk to and what did you discuss?  Details,
please!</li>
<li>What were your overall general impressions of the Career fair?  Was this a
worthwhile experience?</li>
</ol>
