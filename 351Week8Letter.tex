\maketitle

I strongly support Student's application to your program.

Student was a student in three of my courses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mathematics for Infants: a basic course on counting.
\item Discrete Mathematics I: an advanced course on counting.
\item Discrete Mathematics II: the revenge of Discrete Mathematics I.
\end{enumerate}

In every class Student was the quintessential ``A'' student, turning in
excellent work at all times.  Her assignments were among the first I would
grade.

After working with her closely, I have personally witnessed these strengths in
Student time and time again:
\begin{itemize}
\item Student's mathematical preparation is excellent. She has a strong grasp
  of mathematical ideas.
\item Student can communicate mathematics lucidly.  I have seen explain
  mathematical ideas to peers with ease.
\item It is obvious that Student takes her career and studies seriously.  She
  takes direction well.
\end{itemize}

Please give Student's application serious attention.  She certainly has my
wholehearted recommendation.  Please contact me at {\color{CalPolyGreen}
  \texttt{aamendes@calpoly.edu}} for further information.

Sincerely,
