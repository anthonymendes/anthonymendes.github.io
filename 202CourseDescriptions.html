<title>Course descriptions</title>
</head>
<body><div><p>The <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-outlines">mathematics department course outlines</a> describe our courses, but sometimes
with technical jargon and unfamiliar terminology.  So here we give informal
descriptions of our amazing mathematics courses!
</p>

<dl><dt>Math 304, 404</dt><dd><strong>Vector analysis</strong> continues the study of multivariable
calculus from Calculus IV.  Main results in the course,
which have important physical interpretations, generalize of
the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions.
<strong>Differential Geometry</strong> is a continuation of vector analysis
and focuses more on the theory of curves and surfaces in
space.</dd>
<dt>Math 306, 406</dt><dd><strong>Linear algebra</strong> deals with linear functions between
abstract vector spaces and how these functions can be
represented with matrices.  Linear algebra is an extremely
useful subject that finds applications in computer science,
economics, statistics, physics and business, and more!
Students should be ready for an abstract, proof heavy
course.</dd>
<dt>Math 334</dt><dd><strong>Combinatorics</strong> is the mathematics of counting.  The techniques and
ideas in combinatorics can be accessible to those with a modest
math background.  Combinatorial ideas are used regularly in many
other areas of mathematics.</dd>
<dt>Math 335</dt><dd><strong>Graph Theory</strong> is the study of sets of objects (vertices) and the
relations (edges) that exist between them.  Graph theory finds
applications in many disciplines, especially computer science.</dd>
<dt>Math 341</dt><dd><strong>Number Theory</strong> considers the mathematics of the integers, giving a
precise foundation to some of these properties that we have known
("believed'' is a better word here) since elementary
school. Prime numbers are studied.  This course provides the
theoretical underpinnings for most modern applications of
cryptography.</dd>
<dt>Math 344</dt><dd><strong>Linear Analysis</strong> is an applied course on solving differential
equations with new tools such as the Laplace transform, series,
and Fourier series.  Many of these topics are especially relevant
to applications of mathematics to engineering.</dd>
<dt>Math 350</dt><dd><strong>Mathematical Software</strong> introduces how to implement advanced
mathematics on the computer using a high level programming
language, usually in Mathematica.  The ability to use software to
investigate mathematical ideas is an indispensable tool to many
modern mathematicians.  This course does not count towards the
mathematics minor.</dd>
<dt>Math 410, 411</dt><dd><strong>Complex Analysis</strong> explores the calculus of complex valued
functions.  It turns out that a complex valued function
being differentiable implies a host of elegant geometric and
computational properties.  These are good courses for
students who like calculus, geometry, and visualization.</dd>
<dt>Math 412, 413, 414</dt><dd><strong>Real Analysis</strong> rigorously proves theorems first
introduced in Calculus, including theorems about limits, sequences,
series, and derivatives.  Courses usually begin start with a detailed
study of the real numbers from first principles.  As Calculus is
fundamental to many subjects, so is Real Analysis.  This is one of the
core courses in all of mathematics.</dd>
<dt>Math 416, 418</dt><dd><strong>Differential Equations</strong> and <strong>Partial Differential Equations</strong>
are advanced courses on solving differential equations in
one and many variables.  These are essential courses for
those going into a career involving mathematical modeling.
There is usually less emphasis on proofs in this course than
other advanced mathematics courses, but that does not mean
they are to be taken lightly!</dd>
<dt>Math 419</dt><dd><strong>History of Mathematics</strong> follows the evolution mathematical
thought from early to modern times.  The contributions of great
mathematicians are introduced.  This course does not count
towards the mathematics minor.</dd>
<dt>Math 435</dt><dd><strong>Discrete Mathematics</strong> is an advanced course on enumeration that
continues where combinatorics left off.  Students who enjoy
thinking about finite sets and structures will be at home in this
challenging but interesting course.</dd>
<dt>Math 437</dt><dd><strong>Game Theory</strong> is the mathematical modeling of conflict and
cooperation.  Always a popular course, Game theory uses linear
optimization techniques to make optimal decisions in a broad
range of contexts.  This topic is especially useful in economics.</dd>
<dt>Math 440</dt><dd><strong>Topology</strong> considers properties of spaces that are invariant under
continuous deformations.  For example, a square can be deformed
into a circle without breaking it, but a figure 8 cannot.  This
is a rigorous and interesting course on spatial geometry and its
deformation.</dd>
<dt>Math 451, 452, 453</dt><dd><strong>Numerical Analysis</strong> introduces computational algorithms
for doing mathematics on the computer.  When does the computer give
accurate and efficient solutions to mathematical problems?  These courses
are an excellent choice for students interested in numerical simulation
and analysis or algorithm development.</dd>
<dt>Math 442, 443</dt><dd><strong>Euclidean Geometry</strong> rigorously develops the axioms and
theorems of Euclidean geometry first introduced in high school.
<strong>Non-Euclidean Geometry</strong> reexamines and changes the traditional Euclidean
axioms, producing new and strange geometries.</dd>
<dt>Math 481, 482, 483</dt><dd><strong>Abstract algebra</strong> is a branch of mathematics that deals
with how to combine mathematical objects.  The algebra sequence consists
of three main subject areas: Group theory (the study of symmetries), ring
theory (the study of polynomials), and field theory (the study of sets
where we can add, subtract, multiply and divide).  This is an absolutely
central subject in pure mathematics.</dd>
