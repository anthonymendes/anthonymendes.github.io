<title>Graduation Plan</title>
</head>
<body><div>
<h1>Graduation Plan</h1><p>The assignment is to create a valid graduation plan to guide your remaining
time at Cal Poly.  This is the most important assignment in Math 202!
</p>

<h2>Creating the plan</h2><p>Creating an individually tailored graduation plan can be complicated.  Please
ensure that
</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan meets all requirements for general education, the major, any
concentration and any minors.</strong>

<p>All such requirements are in the <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-catalog-info">catalog</a> that corresponds to your catalog
year (this can be found in the Academics tab of the Cal Poly Portal,
listed directly under the “Degree Information” subheading).
</p>

<p>General education, major requirements, and concentration requirements are
all found on the curriculum sheet in the <a href="http://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/mymap.php">degree flowcharts &amp; curriculum
displays</a> page.  Follow this closely!
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/ge-2020-comprehensive-guide">general education</a> comprehensive guide can help with selecting
G.E. courses.  The degree progress report in the Portal can help you see
which G.E. courses you still need to complete after AP and transfer
credits are considered.
</p>

<p>When deciding on exactly which courses to take, the <a href="202CourseDescriptions.html">informal course
descriptions</a> can give and idea of what to expect from each course.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Prerequisites are met for each course.</strong>

<p>The <a href="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/math/1/documents/coursesequence.pdf">suggested order</a> of mathematics courses has the prerequisites for each
course.  This information is also found in the <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-outlines">expanded course outlines</a>.
</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://catalog.calpoly.edu/">catalog</a> or the department homepages for prerequisites for
non-mathematics courses.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Courses are offered in the quarters that you plan to take them.</strong>

<p>The <a href="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/math/1/documents/CourseOfferingsByQuarter.pdf">planned course offerings</a> show when courses are offered.  Most upper
division mathematics courses are offered once or twice a year, so be
careful!
</p>

<p>General education courses are available every quarter, although popular
courses fill up quickly.  If completing a minor, visit the minor
department homepage to find when classes are offered.  The registrar also
maintains a list of when <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/term-typically-offered">courses are typically offered</a>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Formatting the plan</h2><p>Format the plan following the template shown in this example:
</p>

<pre><code class="text">Name: Musty Mustang
Catalog: 2020-2021
Concentration: General
Minors: Statistics
Incoming credit:
(MATH 141 MATH 142)
Graduation Plan:
(Fall 2020 MATH 143 PHYS 141 TH 210)
(Winter 2021 PHYS 133 MATH 241 STAT 301 MATH 206)
(Spring 2021 MATH 242 BIO 111 MU 101 ENGL 145)

(Fall 2021 MATH 248 HIST 213 COMS 102 CSC 101)
(Winter 2022 HIST 337 MATH 306 ASTR 324 PHIL 231)
(Spring 2022 ENGL 251 MATH 406 MATH 202 MATH 341)
(Summer 2022 NR 324)

(Winter 2024 MATH 451 MATH 409 STAT 334)
(Spring 2024 STAT 419 PHIL 310 MATH 483)
</code></pre>

<p>Include lines with your name, catalog year, concentration, and any minors.
To help me run the plan through the software that I have written, make sure
that:
</p>
<ol><li>The plan is submitted as plain text (for example, not in a word document
or .pdf file).  This can be done by copy/pasting the text into the
submission box in Canvas.</li>
<li>So prerequisites can be checked,
<ul><li>include a line after <kbd>Incoming credit:</kbd> that includes any courses that
you have credit for (from AP exams, community college courses,
etc.). Format this line in the same way as shown in the example, using
the course prefix in all capital letters (such as <kbd>MATH</kbd>) and then the
course number, separating terms by spaces, and enclosing everything in
parenthesis.</li>
<li>In your graduation plan section, please include courses from previous
quarters that you have passed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Format each quarter listed in your plan on a new line that
<ul><li>starts with a left parenthesis <kbd>(</kbd>,</li>
<li>followed by one of <kbd>Fall</kbd>, <kbd>Winter</kbd>, <kbd>Spring</kbd>, or <kbd>Summer</kbd> and then the
year,</li>
<li>followed by a list of courses written using the course prefix in all
capital letters (such as <kbd>MATH</kbd>) and then the course number.  Separate
everything on the line with spaces (not dashes or commas).</li>
<li>End the line using a right parenthesis <kbd>)</kbd>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting the plan</h2><p>Submit your properly formatted plan on <a href="https://canvas.calpoly.edu">Canvas</a>.  Then come to one of the
"In-class advising" days on our class calendar and get your plan checked by
me during our Math 202 class period.  After your plan successfully passes my
checks you will receive credit for this assignment.
</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I will do my best to find errors in your plan, but my checks
should not be considered an official guarantee that the plan is correct.
