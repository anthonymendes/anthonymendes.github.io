<title>Graduation Plan</title>
</head>
<body><div>
<h1>Graduation Plan</h1><p>The assignment is to create a valid graduation plan to guide your remaining
time at Cal Poly.  This is the most important assignment in Math 202!
</p>

<h2>Creating the plan</h2><p>Creating an individually tailored graduation plan can be complicated.  Please
ensure that
</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan meets all requirements for general education, the major, any
concentration and any minors.</strong>

<p>All such requirements are in the <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-catalog-info">catalog</a>.  Use the catalog corresponding
to your catalog year.  This can be found in the Academics tab of the Cal
Poly Portal, listed directly under the “Degree Information” subheading.
</p>

<p>General education, major requirements, and concentration requirements are
all found on the curriculum sheet in the <a href="http://flowcharts.calpoly.edu/mymap.php">degree flowcharts &amp; curriculum
displays</a> page.  Follow this closely!
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/ge-2020-comprehensive-guide">general education</a> comprehensive guide can help with selecting G.E.s.
</p>

<p>When deciding on exactly which courses to take, the <a href="202CourseDescriptions.html">informal course
descriptions</a> can give you a better idea of what to expect from each
course.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Prerequisites are met for each course.</strong>

<p>The <a href="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/math/1/documents/coursesequence.pdf">suggested order</a> of mathematics courses has the prerequisites for each
course.  This information is also found in the <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-outlines">expanded course outlines</a>.
</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://catalog.calpoly.edu/">catalog</a> or the department homepages for prerequisites for
non-mathematics courses.
</p></li>
<li><strong>Courses are offered in the quarters that you plan to take them.</strong>

<p>The <a href="https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/math/1/documents/CourseOfferingsByQuarter.pdf">planned course offerings</a> show when courses are offered.  Most upper
division mathematics courses are offered once or twice a year, so be
careful!
</p>

<p>General education courses are available every quarter, although popular
courses fill up quickly.  If completing a minor, visit the minor
department homepage to find when classes are offered.  The registrar also
maintains a list of when <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/term-typically-offered">courses are typically offered</a>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It may be helpful to print and fill out the <a href="202Template.pdf">graduation plan worksheet</a> when
working on the plan, especially in preparation of your meeting with your
advisor.
</p>

<h2>Checking the plan</h2><p>You are required to review your graduation plan with an academic advisor.
</p>

<p>There is a mathematics faculty member who is assigned to be your department
advisor.  This is your contact person for any issues that arise when
completing the undergraduate degree.  If you do not know your academic
advisor, please email me (<kbd>aamendes@calpoly.edu</kbd>).  The college <a href="https://csmadvising.calpoly.edu/">student
services</a> department can also help review your plan.
</p>

<p>The mathematics faculty greatly enjoy meeting with students and helping them
plan for the future!  However, faculty are also busy with classes and
research, so please do not wait until the last minute get in contact.
</p>

<p>When meeting with your advisor, please know the answers to these questions:
</p>
<ol><li>Which courses do you plan to take in order to meet all requirements for
general education, the major, any concentration and any minors?</li>
<li>How did you check to see if courses are offered when you want to take
them?</li>
<li>Did you verify that you will meet the prerequisites for each course?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Formatting and submitting the plan</h2><p>Format the plan following the template shown in this example:

</code></pre>

<p>Include lines with your name, catalog year, concentration, minors, and who
checked your plan and when.  Then, to help me run the plan through the
software that I have written, make sure that:
</p>
<ol><li>The plan is submitted as plain text (for example, not in a word document
or .pdf file).  This can be done by copy/pasting the text into the
submission box in Canvas.</li>
<li>So prerequisites can be checked,
<ul><li>include a line after <kbd>Incoming credit:</kbd> that includes any courses that
you have credit for (from AP exams, community college courses,
etc.). Format this line in the same way as shown in the example, using
the course prefix in all capital letters (such as <kbd>MATH</kbd>) and then the
course number, separating terms by spaces, and enclosing everything in
parenthesis.</li>
<li>In your graduation plan section, please include courses from previous
quarters that you have passed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Format each quarter listed in your plan on a new line that
<ul><li>starts with a left parenthesis <kbd>(</kbd>,</li>
<li>followed by one of <kbd>Fall</kbd>, <kbd>Winter</kbd>, <kbd>Spring</kbd>, or <kbd>Summer</kbd> and then the
year,</li>
<li>followed by a list of courses written using the course prefix in all
capital letters (such as <kbd>MATH</kbd>) and then the course number.  Separate
everything on the line with spaces (not dashes or commas).</li>
<li>End the line using a right parenthesis <kbd>)</kbd>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Submit the plan in Canvas on or before the due date.  Credit for this
assignment will only be given for creating a valid graduation plan.
</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I will do my best to find errors in your plan, but my checks
should not be considered an official guarantee that the plan is correct.
