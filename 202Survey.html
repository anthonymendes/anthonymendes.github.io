<h1>Who are you?</h1><p>I would like to get to know you so that I can better serve you!  Please upload
your answers the following questions on Canvas by Apr  2.
</p>

<ol><li>Why did you become a mathematics major?  What do you enjoy about
mathematics?  Do you like proofs?</li>
<li>What ideas do you have about your future career (it is perfectly fine if you
don’t have a solid plan yet)?</li>
<li>If you are planning on teaching, what level do you want to teach?</li>
<li>Do you plan to attend graduate or professional school right after getting
your Bachelor’s degree or are you planning on starting a career?  What are
your current plans?</li>
<li>What are your thoughts on which concentration you will pursue (if any) as a
math major (if you don’t know yet, this course might help you decide!)?</li>
<li>Are you planning to minor or double major?  If so, in what?  This courses
can to help you learn about common minors for math majors.</li>
<li>Are you interested in a career where a significant component of the job is
coding or otherwise working with computers?  Nearly all careers require some
computer work, but if you are particularly interested in such a job or
alternately are hoping to minimize computer work, state that here.</li>
<li>Do you have significant interests or obligations outside math (sports, band,
double major, study abroad, working long hours, childcare) that could make
scheduling courses difficult?</li>
<li>Which <a href="202Opportunities.html">amazing opportunities</a> most appeal to you?</li>
