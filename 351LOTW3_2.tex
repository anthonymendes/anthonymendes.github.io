    List of Books:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Snow Crash} - Snow Crash tells the story of Hiro Protagonist,
            a katana-wielding hacker who jumps back and forth between dystopian Los
            Angeles and a virtual world called the Metaverse. This book is extremely
            goofy with on-the-nose nerd humor. The fact that the main character's name
            is Hiro Protagonist tells you all you need to know\cite{snowcrash}.
        \item \textbf{Neuromancer} - Neuromancer follows its protagonist Case,
            an unemployed computer hacker who is hired by a mysterious new employer
            called Armitage. He’s teamed with Molly, a cyborg, and Peter Riviera, a
            thief and illusionist, to carry out a series of crimes that set the
            stage for the group’s ultimate purpose\cite{neuromancer}.
        \item \textbf{The Grand Budapest Hotel} \cite{frenchdispatch} -
            In 1975, in the fictional French town of Ennui-sur-Blasé (from French,
            literally, "boredom on apathetic"), Arthur Howitzer Jr., the editor of
            the magazine The French Dispatch, dies suddenly of a heart attack.
            According to the wishes expressed in his will, publication of the magazine
            is immediately suspended following one final farewell issue, in which four
            articles are published, along with an obituary. Sounds boring, but I found it
            very fun to watch as there are lots of intertwining stories. - \cite{frenchdispatch}
