<h1>Opportunity is knocking!</h1><p>There are many outstanding opportunities available to mathematics majors.
Please take advantage of them!
</p>

<h2>Academics</h2><ol><li>Minoring with a mathematics major is a great boost to your degree.  These
<a href="202Minors.html">popular minors</a> for mathematics majors are excellent choices.</li>
<li>The Cal Poly math department competes nationally in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition">Putnam
Competition</a> (led by <a href="mailto:sherman1@calpoly.edu">Dr. Morgan Sherman</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Contest_in_Modeling">Math Modeling Competition</a>
(led by <a href="mailto:camp@calpoly.edu">Dr. Dave Camp</a>).  We offer 1 unit courses in Fall quarter to
prepare for the competitions.</li>
<li>Be aware the mathematics department will usually support student travel
to professional conferences, especially to present any research that you
have done with a faculty member.</li>
<li>The mathematics department occasionally emails information about
colloquiums. These are one hour lectures on an advanced topic, usually by
a professor from another university.  They can be a nice window to the
world of research mathematics for students interested in graduate school.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Student Employment</h2><p>Mathematics student employment opportunities include:
</p>
<ol><li><a href="https://writingandlearning.calpoly.edu/become-tutor">tutoring</a> in the <a href="https://writingandlearning.calpoly.edu/center">math help hub</a> in the <a href="https://writingandlearning.calpoly.edu">Writing and Learning Center</a>,</li>
<li>working as a mathematics <a href="https://asc.calpoly.edu/student-employment-asc">workshop or study session leader</a> with the
<a href="https://asc.calpoly.edu/">Academic Skills Center</a>,</li>
<li>becoming an upper-division mathematics department workshop leader (contact
the department after earning an <kbd>A</kbd> in a course such as <kbd>MATH 306</kbd> or
<kbd>MATH 412</kbd>), and</li>
<li>working as a homework grader (inquire with a professor with whom you have
a good relationship).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summertime</h2><p>Excellent uses of your summer include:
</p>
<ol><li>The <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/summer-research">Frost summer research program</a> where you are paid to work closely with
a faculty member on cutting edge research.  This special program is only
available to Cal Poly students!</li>
<li>The National Science Foundation funds the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/">Research Experiences for
Undergraduates</a> (REU) program.  This is a highly competitive nationwide
program where you are given a stipend to go to another university to
conduct mathematics research.  This looks great on applications to
Ph.D. programs, so plan ahead an apply early!</li>
<li>Many companies have summer internships for mathematics majors.  The job
fair and <a href="https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly Career Services</a> can help you find an internship at an
interesting organization.  Many successful internships have translated
into job offers!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fun with friends!</h2><ol><li>Contrary to the stereotype, math majors are social!  We have <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/clubs">two clubs</a>
for having fun as a mathematics major: the Math Club and the <a href="https://awm-math.org/">Association
for Women in Mathematics</a>.  The Math Club hosts annual events such as
faculty-student poker tournaments, softball games, and barbecues.</li>
<li>Study for your classes with other math majors (or just goof off!) in the
private mathematics student lounge in the Baker science center.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Career advice</h2><p>Career advice for mathematics majors is provided by the <a href="http://www.ams.org/profession/career-info/career-index">American
Mathematical Society</a>, the <a href="https://www.siam.org/students-education/programs-initiatives/thinking-of-a-career-in-applied-mathematics">Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</a>,
and the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/home.aspx">American Statistical Association</a>.
