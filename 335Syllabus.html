<h2>Textbook</h2><p>There is no textbook for the course.  Detailed notes are on the course web
site.
</p>

<h2>Course content</h2><p>Topics include graph isomorphism, vertex colorings, trees, planar graphs,
Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths, connectivity, matchings, the adjacency
matrix, and the Laplacian.
</p>

<p>The prerequisite for this course is MATH 248 or junior standing.  At a
minimum, students should have had exposure to basic proof techniques (such
as proof by contradiction and proof by induction).
</p>

<p>Some topics use concepts from matrix algebra (such as eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, diagonalization, and properties of real symmetric matrices).
There may be a brief introduction to some of the needed concepts, but a
basic familiarity with matrices is assumed.
</p>

<p>Warning: This is a rigorous course that contains challenging topics and
exercises.  Students who have never taken a 300+ level mathematics course
are advised to form study groups.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2><p>Letter grades are based on the exercises, two midterms, and a final exam.
The proportions of the total grade given to each activity are:

<h2>Exercise Sets</h2><p>The exercise sets are important and high quality work is expected.  You will
not receive credit for an exercise unless careful explanations are included.
Please turn in assignments of a quality appropriate for a professional
workplace.
</p>

<p>Please get started on the exercises early!  To keep everyone on track, late
assignments will be penalized 20% per day late.  If life issues get in the
way, please let me know before the assignment is due so that we can make
special arrangements.
</p>

<p>Follow these steps when turning in the assignments and exams:
</p>
<ol><li>Neatly and clearly write out the solutions by hand.  This may require
writing rough drafts; please do not submit messy scratch work.</li>
<li>It is difficult to read and grade <kbd>.jpg</kbd> image files, so please create a
single <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file from your exercise sets using a document scanner phone
application.</li>
<li>Upload the file to in our Canvas site before the due date.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using a tablet to write out solutions or know mathematical
typesetting (LaTeX) or have any other method of creating legible solutions
in a <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file, then of course this can be used instead of handwritten
solutions.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2><p>There are two midterm exams and one final exam.  Midterm topics will be
announced in class.  The final exam is cumulative.
</p>

<p>The midterm exams for both sections are on October  8  and
November  5  during class time.
</p>

<p>The final exam for the 12pm section is on December  8  at
10:10am in our classroom.
</p>

<p>The final exam for the 1pm section is on December 10  at
1:10pm in our classroom.
</p>

<h2>Academic honesty</h2><p>The table below clarifies which resources are available for use on exercise
sets and exams.  A "No" means the resource is not permitted and a "Yes"
means that it is permitted.

<h2>Diversity</h2><p>I am committed to providing an atmosphere that is welcoming to everyone.  It
is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be
well served by this course.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2><p>Students registered with the Disability Resource Center should contact me
early in the course with their approved accommodations so that we can make
the necessary arrangements.
