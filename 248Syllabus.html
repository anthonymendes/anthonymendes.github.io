<h2>Web site</h2><p>The main course web site is <a href="https://anthonymendes.github.io/248.html">https://anthonymendes.github.io/248.html</a>
Assignments will be turned in using <a href="https://canvas.calpoly.edu">Canvas</a> in the <a href="https://my.calpoly.edu">portal</a>.
</p>

<h2>Time zone</h2><p>All times and dates for this course are in Pacific Standard Time.
</p>

<h2>Office hours</h2><p>During the quarter it is natural to have questions on the course material,
grading, exam questions or career advice, and I look forward to helping you!
</p>

<p>Office hours will be held on Zoom at these times between Jun 22
  and Aug 13:

<p>The zoom link was sent to you in the course introduction email.  Email me if
you need the link resent.
</p>

<p>You can also email me questions at any time!  However, it is difficult to
communicate complicated mathematical ideas through email and so please try to
visit my office hours for questions of that nature.  I will usually respond
to your email by the next business day, probably sooner.
</p>

<p>I greatly enjoy meeting you, getting to know you, and answering your
questions, no matter how trivial they may seem.
</p>

<h2>Free tutoring</h2><p>Free one-on-one and drop-in-anytime tutoring is available from the <a href="https://calpoly.mywconline.com/">Writing
and Learning Center</a>.  Graduate and undergraduate math tutors are available for both
one-to-one and small-group sessions. Students can view the schedule, schedule
appointments, and join sessions at <a href="https://calpoly.mywconline.com/">https://calpoly.mywconline.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37IqysCCyc">short video</a> introduces the support available and demonstrates how to
connect with a tutor.
</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2><p>Our text is <a href="BookOfProofHammack.pdf"><em>Book of Proof, 3rd Edition</em></a> by Richard Hammack, a high quality
open source text.  The text web site is <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/">http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/</a>.
</p>

<h2>Content and learning objectives</h2><p>I have been greatly looking forward to sharing the ideas in this course with
you!
</p>

<p>This class is not unlike a foreign language class.  Just like Spanish class
where you learn to read, write, and understand Spanish, in this course you
will read, write, and understand mathematics!  There are also some
fundamental topics such as sets, equivalence relations, and functions that
will be introduced along the way.  The <a href="https://math.calpoly.edu/course-outlines">official department course outline</a>
contains more details on the course content.
</p>

<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to
</p>

<ol><li>demonstrate an understanding of how mathematics is communicated,</li>
<li>determine when logical statements are equivalent,</li>
<li>apply standard techniques (direct proof, contradiction, induction, etc.)
in proving theorems,</li>
<li>construct clear and concise proofs of elementary theorems, and</li>
<li>use fundamental mathematical objects (such as set, relation, function) in
logical arguments.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Exercise Sets</h2><p>The exercise sets are important and high quality work is expected.  You will
not receive credit for an exercise unless careful explanations are included.
Please turn in assignments of a quality appropriate for a professional
workplace.
</p>

<p>Please get started on the exercises early!  Material in this course builds on
itself---if you fall behind then it will be a challenge for you to catch up.
To keep everyone on track, late assignments will be penalized 20% per day
late.  If life issues get in the way, please let me know before the
assignment is due so that we can make special arrangements.
</p>

<p>Follow these steps when turning in the assignments and exams:
</p>
<ol><li>Neatly and clearly write out the solutions by hand.  This may require
writing rough drafts; please do not submit messy scratch work.</li>
<li>It is difficult to read and grade <kbd>.jpg</kbd> image files, so please create a
single <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file from your exercise sets using a document scanner phone
application.</li>
<li>Upload the file to in our Canvas site before the due date.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using a tablet to write out solutions or know mathematical
typesetting (LaTeX) or have any other method of creating legible solutions in
a <kbd>.pdf</kbd> file, then of course this can be used instead of handwritten
solutions.
</p>

<p>Exercises will be graded by a teaching assistant and I will grade the
exams. The homework grader will randomly select a subset of exercises to
grade carefully for accuracy.  Please contact me when you have questions
about grading.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2><p>There are two midterm exams and one final exam.
</p>
<ul><li>Midterm 1 covers the content included in the exercises found in Set 1
through Set 5.  It can be accessed in Canvas on Jul  9
      at your scheduled class time.  Solutions should be uploaded to Canvas
one hour later in the same way that you have been turning in the
exercises.</li>
<li>Midterm 2 covers the content included in the exercises found in Set 6
through Set 10.  It can be accessed in Canvas on Jul 30
      at your scheduled class time.</li>
<li>The final exam is cumulative but will emphasize the topics not covered on
the midterms.  It can be accessed in Canvas on Aug 13
at your scheduled class time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to the Academic Honesty section below for which resources are
permitted on exams.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2><p>Letter grades are based on the exercises, two midterms, and a final exam.
The proportions of the total grade given to each activity are:

<h2>Academic honesty</h2><p>The nature of virtual classes may tempt some students into committing an act
of academic dishonesty.  Please take pride in yourself and your work,
practice integrity, and respect the efforts of your classmates and your
professor.
</p>

<p>The table below clarifies which resources are available for use on exercise
sets and exams.  A "No" means the resource is not permitted and a "Yes"
means that it is permitted.

<p>For exams please realize that I can see when students view the videos, visit
my website, and log into Canvas.  Please do not place me into a
uncomfortable situation where I must take actions that I do not want to
take.
</p>

<h2>Diversity</h2><p>I am committed to providing an atmosphere of learning that is welcoming to
everyone.  It is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and
perspectives will be well served by this course.  Please join me in acting
with care and empathy for all members of our community.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2><p>Students registered with the Disability Resource Center should contact me
early in the course with their approved accommodations so that we can make
the necessary arrangements.
